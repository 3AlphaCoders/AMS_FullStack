**Background**: Web-Based solution to track the status of document/file going through approval process in any department.

**Problem Summary**:

- All the Institutes/Departments under the Ministry are using some common file/document movement and approval procedures. The physical movement of such files/documents has many disadvantages.

- When a document file is under process of approval, the location of the file document where it has been delayed on the way while moving from table to table, is very difficult to trace. The status of a document/file which has been initiated is not traceable until it returns back to the parent section/Office.

- During physical movement of files, there is every chance of missing files. Due to natural disasters or mistakes on an individual level, files/documents may get damaged. There is a possibility of tampering of documents even after the same has been approved/closed.

- There is wastage of huge amounts of paper and printing expenses. This procedure also requires attendants/peons/MTS personnel for the physical movement of files. It requires huge space for storing files/record keeping.

**Objective**:

- Formulation of a common file/document movement procedure, which can be customized to suit the systems in different departments/sections and Institutions. Development of a web-based integrated platform for creation, forwarding, rejection/approval of documents/files.

- User creation and user rights management Development of user-friendly web-based platforms for managing files under different categories.
